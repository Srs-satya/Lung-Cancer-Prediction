# Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various features. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally, and early detection plays a vital role in effective treatment. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aspires to assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset Information

- **Number of Entries**: 309  
- **Number of Features**: 16  

Each row in the dataset represents an individual, and each column corresponds to a specific attribute or feature associated with that individual.

## Features Included

The dataset contains the following features (example list; update with actual features):  
- Age  
- Smoking History  
- Genetic Factors  
- Air Pollution Exposure  
- Symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath  
- And more...

## Machine Learning Models Used

To build and evaluate the predictive model, the following algorithms were implemented:

1. **Logistic Regression**  
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
3. **Random Forest Regression**  
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
